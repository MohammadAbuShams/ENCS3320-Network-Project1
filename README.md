# ENCS3320 Computer Networks - Project1

## Overview
This project involves creating various network applications using socket programming in Java. It consists of three main parts: network diagnostics commands, a client-server application that communicates over TCP and UDP, and a simple web server that responds to HTTP requests.

## Part 1: Network Diagnostics
- **Tasks**:
  1. Explain in your own words what `ping`, `tracert`, and `nslookup` are.
  2. Execute and provide explanations for:
     - Pinging a device within the same network.
     - Pinging `www.yale.edu`.
     - Tracing the route to `www.yale.edu`.
     - Performing `nslookup` on `www.yale.edu`.
  - **Requirement**: Include screenshots with the date and time visible.

## Part 2: TCP and UDP Client-Server Application
- **Description**: Implement a server that counts messages received from a client that sends numbers from 0 to 1,000,000 over both TCP and UDP.
- **Execution Environments**:
  1. On the same computer.
  2. On two different computers connected by cable or through a switch.
  3. On two different computers connected through WiFi.
- **Measurements**: Record and report the number of packets received, and the time taken to send and receive packets.

## Part 3: Simple Web Server
- **Functionality**:
  - Serve different content types including HTML, CSS, PNG, and JPEG files.
  - Handle specific paths and redirect certain requests.
  - Implement error handling for not found resources.
- **Technologies**: Can be implemented in Go, Python, Java, or C.
- **Specific Tasks**:
  1. Serve a home page with specific content requirements.
  2. Respond to path-based requests in different languages.
  3. Redirect some requests to external URLs.
  4. Print HTTP requests on the command line.
